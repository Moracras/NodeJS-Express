Database Setup:
Set up a database using Sequelize to store book information.
Define a Book model with attributes such as title,image, author, ISBN, genre, and publicationYear.
CRUD Operations:
Implement the following CRUD operations for books:
Create: Users should be able to add new book records to the database.
Read: Users should be able to view a list of all books in the library.
Update: Users should be able to edit book information.
Delete: Users should be able to remove book records from the library.
API Endpoints:
Create RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on books (e.g., /books for listing all books, /books/:id for specific book operations).
Validation and Error Handling:
Implement input validation to ensure that users provide necessary book details.
Handle errors and provide meaningful error messages.
User Interface (Optional):
You can create a simple web interface for users to interact with the system using React or HTML-CSS and JavaScript.
Implement forms for adding, updating, and deleting books.
You can explore the 'cors' package to do this.
Documentation:
Provide clear and well-documented code.
Include a README file that explains how to set up and run the project locally.
